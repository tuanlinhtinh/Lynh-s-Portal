## Why CodeFlow?

Ever opened a new codebase and felt completely lost? **CodeFlow** turns any GitHub repository or local codebase into an interactive architecture map in seconds.

- **No installation required** — runs entirely in your browser
- **No data collection** — your code never leaves your machine
- **No accounts** — just paste a URL or select local files and go
- **Works offline** — analyze local files without internet

```
⚡ Paste URL / Select Files → See Architecture → Make Better Decisions
```

## Features

### 🗺️ **Interactive Dependency Graph**
See how your files connect at a glance. Click any node to highlight its dependencies. Drag, zoom, and explore.

### 💥 **Blast Radius Analysis**
*"If I change this file, what breaks?"* — CodeFlow answers this instantly. Select any file and see exactly how many files would be affected by changes.

### 👥 **Code Ownership**
Know who owns what. See the top contributors for any file based on git history. Perfect for code reviews and knowing who to ask.

### 🔐 **Security Scanner**
Automatic detection of:
- Hardcoded secrets & API keys
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Dangerous `eval()` usage
- Debug statements in production code

### 🧩 **Pattern Detection**
Automatically identifies:
- Singleton patterns
- Factory patterns
- Observer/Event patterns
- React custom hooks
- Anti-patterns (God Objects, high coupling)

### 📊 **Health Score**
Get an instant A-F grade for your codebase based on:
- Dead code percentage
- Circular dependencies
- Coupling metrics
- Security issues

### 🔥 **Activity Heatmap**
Color files by commit frequency to see which parts of your codebase are most actively developed.

### 📋 **PR Impact Analysis**
Paste a PR URL to see exactly which files it affects and calculate the blast radius of proposed changes.

### 💻 **Local File Analysis**
Analyze code directly from your computer without uploading to GitHub:
- **Privacy First:** Your code never leaves your machine
- **Offline Support:** Works without internet connection
- **Drag & Drop:** Simply drag files or folders to analyze
- **Folder Scanning:** Recursively analyze entire project structures
- **Exclude Patterns:** Skip attachments, caches, generated assets, and other irrelevant paths before scanning
- **Instant Results:** All processing happens in your browser

---

## Privacy First

**Your code stays on your machine.** CodeFlow:

- ✅ Runs 100% in the browser
- ✅ Makes API calls directly from your browser to GitHub
- ✅ Never stores your code or tokens
- ✅ Works with private repos (just add your token locally)
- ✅ No analytics or tracking

Your GitHub token (if used) is only stored in your browser's memory and is cleared when you close the tab.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Online (Recommended)
Just visit [CodeFlow](https://codeflow-five.vercel.app/) and paste any GitHub URL.

### Option 2: Self-Host
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/braedonsaunders/codeflow.git

# That's it! Just open index.html in your browser
open index.html
```

No build process. No dependencies. No npm install. **It's just one HTML file.**

### Option 3: Analyze Local Files
You can now analyze code directly from your local machine without uploading to GitHub:

1. Open CodeFlow in your browser
2. Click the "📁 Local Files" button
3. Select the folder or files you want to analyze
4. CodeFlow will process them entirely in your browser

**Perfect for:**
- Private projects you don't want to upload
- Offline development
- Quick local analysis before committing
- Working with sensitive code

---

## Usage

### Public Repositories
```
Just paste: facebook/react
Or full URL: https://github.com/facebook/react
```

### Private Repositories
1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
2. Paste it in the Token field
3. Analyze your private repos

### Local Files
Click the "📁 Local Files" button to analyze code from your computer:
- **Folder Analysis:** Select a folder to analyze all supported files recursively
- **File Selection:** Choose specific files to analyze
- **Drag & Drop:** Drag files or folders directly onto the page
- **Custom Excludes:** Add patterns like `uploads/**`, `**/cache/**`, or `*.png` before scanning

All processing happens locally in your browser - nothing is uploaded.

### Shareable Links
After analysis, click 🔗 to copy a shareable link. Anyone can re-run the same analysis.

### 📤 **Export Reports**
Export your analysis in multiple formats for further processing:

- **JSON Report** - Complete analysis data including:
  - Repository metadata and health score
  - All files with functions, dependencies, and churn data
  - Complete function statistics with callers and usage metrics
  - Security issues, patterns, and architecture issues
  - Duplicate code detection and layer violations
  - Suggestions and recommendations
  - Language breakdown and folder structure
  
  Perfect for programmatic analysis, CI/CD integration, or custom reporting tools.

- **Markdown Report** - Human-readable formatted report
- **Plain Text Report** - Simple text format
- **SVG Image** - Export the dependency graph visualization
- **Raw JSON** - Simplified data export

Click the 📤 Export button in the top bar after analysis to access all export options.

## API Limits

GitHub API has rate limits:
- **Without token:** 60 requests/hour
- **With Personal Access Token:** 5,000 requests/hour
- **With GitHub App:** 5,000 requests/hour per installation

### Authentication Methods

#### Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
2. Paste it in the Token field
3. Analyze your private repos

#### GitHub App Authentication
For teams and organizations, GitHub App provides better security and higher rate limits:

1. Create a [GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps) with repository permissions
2. Install the app on your organization or personal account
3. Generate an installation access token
4. Paste the token in the Token field

**Benefits of GitHub App:**
- ✅ Fine-grained permissions control
- ✅ Revocable access per installation
- ✅ Higher rate limits (5,000 requests/hour)
- ✅ Audit logging and security monitoring
- ✅ No need to share personal credentials

For larger repositories or team usage, we recommend using GitHub App authentication.

## FAQ

**Q: How does it work without a backend?**
> CodeFlow runs entirely in your browser. It calls the GitHub API directly from your browser and processes everything client-side.

**Q: Is my code safe?**
> Yes. Your code is fetched directly from GitHub to your browser. Nothing is sent to any server we control. Check the source — it's one file!

**Q: Can I use it offline?**
> Yes! With the new Local Files feature, you can analyze code from your computer without any internet connection. Just click the "📁 Local Files" button and select your files. All processing happens entirely in your browser.

**Q: Why is analysis slow?**
> We make individual API calls for each file to get content. With a token, you get higher rate limits and faster analysis.

**Q: How accurate is the dependency analysis?**
> It's based on function name matching, so it may miss some dynamic imports or renamed imports. It's designed for a quick overview, not 100% accuracy.
